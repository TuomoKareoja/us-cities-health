Main BCHI dataset

Over 17,000 data points on different health indicators for the 28 BCHC member cities.
It has more than 50 health, socio-economic, and demographic indicators across 11 categories.
It is a standardized data collection hub that allows for comparability of health indicators across city jurisdictions.

Comes from http://www.bigcitieshealth.org/city-data. See site for more information about the measures.

Gini-index dataset

Is not in metropolitan area level and not city. For example New York is mixed with New Jersey.
This data was used because I could not find freely available city level data.

Comes from https://datausa.io/
